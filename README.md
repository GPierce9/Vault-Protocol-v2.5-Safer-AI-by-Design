# Vault-Protocol-v2.5-Safer-AI-by-Design
Vault Protocol is an integrated, trauma-informed safety architecture built inside the model’s runtime, not bolted on. The upshot is (1) lower cost, (2) lower damage ceiling, and (3) humane guardrails. By weaving guardrails into the system’s own process, Vault aims for layered safety without sacrificing utility or dignity.
